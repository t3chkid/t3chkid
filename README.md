# Hi there 👋

I’m a passionate Android developer 💚 and a huge Kotlin enthusiast💜. I also have a very keen interest in software architecture 👷🏻. I was primarily a Java developer until I got to taste Kotlin.  I became an ardent fan of Kotlin the day I wrote the first line of Kotlin code. I have 2 years of experience using Kotlin. Recently I got really interested into CI and automating CI workflows 🤖. I am also a big fan of IDE’s built by Jetbrains and I’ve been working with IntelliJ and Android Studio for more than three years. I also have experience working with Firebase Authentication,Cloud Firestore and Firebase storage.

- 💛 Tools and Technologies I love : Kotlin, Jetpack compose, Coroutines , Github Actions
- 📱I’m currently working on two Android apps - Examer (An app focused on quizzes based on audio files) and Pocket ( A clone of the popular Pocket app) 
- 👨🏻‍💻I’m currently learning about CI and automating CI workflows with Github actions.
- 😄 Pronouns : he/his
- 🎾 Fun fact : Besides programming, I also really like to play tennis.
